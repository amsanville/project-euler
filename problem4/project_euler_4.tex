\section*{Problem Statement}
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.\\[12pt]

\noindent Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
\section*{Solution}
Consider two three digit numbers $a$ and $b$. Because $a, b \le 999$, the all the palindromic numbers, $n$, to be considered must have $n < 999^{2} = 998001$.
